abstract = {Large-scale Internet services require a computing infrastructure that can beappropriately described as a warehouse-sized computing system. The cost ofbuilding datacenter facilities capable of delivering a given power capacity tosuch a computer can rival the recurring energy consumption costs themselves.Therefore, there are strong economic incentives to operate facilities as closeas possible to maximum capacity, so that the non-recurring facility costs canbe best amortized. That is difficult to achieve in practice because ofuncertainties in equipment power ratings and because power consumption tends tovary significantly with the actual computing activity. Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget. In this paper we present the aggregate power usage characteristics of largecollections of servers (up to 15 thousand) for different classes ofapplications over a period of approximately six months. Those observationsallow us to evaluate opportunities for maximizing the use of the deployed powercapacity of datacenters, and assess the risks of over-subscribing it. We findthat even in well-tuned applications there is a noticeable gap (7 - 16{\%})between achieved and theoretical aggregate peak power usage at the clusterlevel (thousands of servers). The gap grows to almost 40{\%} in wholedatacenters. This headroom can be used to deploy additional compute equipmentwithin the same power budget with minimal risk of exceeding it. We use ourmodeling framework to estimate the potential of power management schemes toreduce peak power and energy usage. We find that the opportunities for powerand energy savings are significant, but greater at the cluster-level (thousandsof servers) than at the rack-level (tens). Finally we argue that systems needto be power efficient across the activity range, and not only at peakperformance levels.},

abstract = {Measuring the energy consumption of software components is a major building block for generating models that allow for energy-aware scheduling, accounting and budgeting. Cur- rent measurement techniques focus on coarse-grained mea- surements of application or system events. However, fine grain adjustments in particular in the operating-system ker- nel and in application-level servers require power profiles at the level of a single software function. Until recently, this appeared to be impossible due to the lacking fine grain res- olution and high costs of measurement equipment. In this paper we report on our experience in using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) energy sensors avail- able in recent Intel CPUs for measuring energy consumption of short code paths. We investigate the granularity at which RAPL measurements can be performed and discuss practical obstacles that occur when performing these measurements on complex modern CPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the RAPL infrastructure to characterize the en- ergy costs for decoding video slices.},

An ever-increasing complexity and the number of components present new challenges to software developers interested in finding operating points that strike an optimal bal-ance between performance and energy consumed. In this paper we analyze the impact of thread scaling and frequency scaling on performance and energy in modern multicores. By exploiting recent additions to microprocessors that support energy estimation and power management, we measure execution times and energy consumed on an Intel Xeon 1240 v2 microprocessor when run-ning the PARSEC benchmark suite. We conduct a number of experiments by varying the number of threads, 1 ≤ N ≤ 16, and processor clock frequency, 1.6 ≤ F ≤ 3.4 GHz. We find that the maximum performance is achieved when the number of threads matches or slightly exceeds the number of logical processors (8 ≤ N ≤ 12) and the clock frequency is at maximum (F = 3.4 GHz). The minimum energy is consumed when the pro-cessor clock frequency is in range 2.0 ≤ F ≤ 2.4 GHz. Finally, we find that the best performance at minimal energy is achieved when 8 ≤ N ≤ 12 and 2.8 ≤ F ≤ 3.1 GHz.},

abstract = {This paper approaches the problem of improving the service center server CPU's energy efficiency by executing dynamic frequency scaling actions and performing tradeoffs between CPU's computational performance and its power consumption. Two different algorithms are designed and implemented: an immune inspired algorithm and a fuzzy logic based algorithm. The immune inspired algorithm uses the human antigen as a model to represent the server power / performance state. Using a set of detectors the antigens are classified as self for optimal power consumption state or non-self for non-optimal power consumption state. For the non-self antigens a biologically inspired clonal selection approach is used to determine the actions that need to be executed to bring the server's CPU in an optimal power consumption state. The fuzzy logic based algorithm adaptively changes the processor performance states to the incoming workload. The algorithm also filters workload spikes because frequent p-states transition costs can outweigh the benefit of adaptation.},

Among these changes are integrated voltage regulators that enable individual voltages and frequencies for every core. In this paper we analyze a number of consequences of this development that are of utmost importance for energy efficiency optimization strategies such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and dynamic concurrency throttling (DCT). This includes the enhanced RAPL implementation and its improved accuracy as it moves from modeling to actual measurement. Another fundamental change is that every clock speed above AVX frequency -- including nominal frequency -- is opportunistic and unreliable, which vastly decreases performance predictability with potential effects on scalability. Moreover, we characterize significantly changed p-state transition behavior, and determine crucial memory performance data.},

@article{Du2017,
abstract = {We describe a family of power models that can capture the nonuniform power effects of speed scaling among homogeneous cores on multicore processors. These models depart from traditional ones, which assume that individual cores contribute to power consumption as independent entities. In our approach, we remove this independence assumption and employ statistical variables of core speed (average speed and the dispersion of the core speeds) to capture the comprehensive heterogeneous impact of subtle interactions among the underlying hardware. We systematically explore the model family, deriving basic and refined models that give progressively better fits, and analyze them in detail. The proposed methodology provides an easy way to build power models to reflect the realistic workings of current multicore processors more accurately. Moreover, unlike the existing lower-level power models that require knowledge of microarchitectural details of the CPU cores and the last level cache to capture core interdependency, ours are easier to use and scalable to emerging and future multicore architectures with more cores. These attributes make the models particularly useful to system users or algorithm designers who need a quick way to estimate power consumption. We evaluate the family of models on contemporary x86 multicore processors using the SPEC2006 benchmarks. Our best model yields an average predicted error as low as 5{\%}.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important feature for both mobile and high-performance server systems. Most processors designed today include power management features that provide processor operating points which can be used in power management algorithms. However, existing power management algorithms implicitly assume that lower performance points are more energy efficient than higher performance points. Our empirical observations indicate that for many systems, this assumption is not valid.We introduce a new concept called critical power slope to explain and capture the power-performance characteristics of systems with power management features. We evaluate three systems - a clock throttled Pentium laptop, a frequency scaled PowerPC platform, and a voltage scaled system to demonstrate the benefits of our approach. Our evaluation is based on empirical measurements of the first two systems, and publicly available data for the third. Using critical power slope, we explain why on the Pentium-based system, it is energy efficient to run only at the highest frequency, while on the PowerPC-based system, it is energy efficient to run at the lowest frequency point. We confirm our results by measuring the behavior of a web serving benchmark. Furthermore, we extend the critical power slope concept to understand the benefits of voltage scaling when combined with frequency scaling. We show that in some cases, it may be energy efficient not to reduce voltage below a certain point.},

On the basis of these experiments, it is expected that SVR will have advantages in high dimensionality space because SVR optimization does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances have greatly improved the performance and features of embedded systems. With the number of just mobile devices now reaching nearly equal to the population of Earth, embedded systems have truly become ubiquitous. These trends, however, have also made the task of managing their power consumption extremely challenging. In recent years, several techniques have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we survey the techniques for managing power consumption of embedded systems. We discuss the need of power management and provide a classification of the techniques on several important parameters to highlight their similarities and differences. This paper is intended to help the researchers and application-developers in gaining insights into the working of power management techniques and designing even more efficient high-performance embedded systems of tomorrow.},

However, when tasks are memory bounded, further energy improvement could be obtained. In this paper we analyze the effect of memory boundedness in a state-of-the-art energy efficient hard real-time scheduling algorithm, and we propose a new technique to take into account these effects to substantially improve energy efficiency of the scheduling algorithm while still preventing deadline misses. The proposed technique is compared to a state-of-the-art hard real-time scheduling algorithm from energy efficiency viewpoint. Results show an energy reduction from 15{\%} to 90{\%} depending on the amount of memory boundedness of the task. {\textcopyright}2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {As the number of cores per processor grows, there is a strong incentive to develop parallel workloads to take advantage of the hardware parallelism. In comparison to single-threaded applications, parallel workloads are more complex to characterize due to thread interactions and resource stalls. This paper presents an accurate and scalable method for determining the optimal system operating points (i.e., number of threads and DVFS settings) at runtime for parallel workloads under a set of objective functions and constraints that optimize for energy efficiency in multi-core processors. Using an extensive training data set gathered for a wide range of parallel workloads on a commercial multi-core system, we construct multinomial logistic regression (MLR) models that estimate the optimal system settings as a function of workload characteristics. We use L1-regularization to automatically determine the relevant workload metrics for energy optimization. At runtime, our technique determines the optimal number of threads and the DVFS setting with negligible overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior techniques with up to 51{\%} improved decision accuracy. This translates to up to 10.6{\%} average improvement in energy-performance operation, with a maximum improvement of 30.9{\%}. Our technique also demonstrates superior scalability as the number of potential system operating points increases.},

@article{DaCosta2015,
abstract = {In High Performance Computing, being respectful of the environment is usually secondary compared to performance: The faster, the better. As Exascale computing is in the spotlight, electric power concerns arise as current exascale projects might need too much power to even boot. A recent incentive (Exascale at maximum 20MW) shows that reality is catching up with HPC center designers. Beyond classical works on hardware infrastructure or at the middleware level, we do believe that system-level solutions have great potential for energy reduction. Moreover energy-reduction has often been neglected by the HPC community that focus mainly on raw computing performance. In the literature, energy savings is achieved mainly by two means: Either processor load is the only metric taken into account to reduce processors frequency and to ensure no impact on raw performances; Or processor frequency is managed only at task level outside the critical path. In this article we show that designing and implementing a DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) mechanism based on instantaneous system values (here network activity) can save up to 25{\%} of energy consumption while reducing marginally performance. In several cases, reducing energy consumption also leads to an increase in performances because of the thermal budget of recent processors. This work is validated with real experiments on a linux cluster using the NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB).},

abstract = {We present Continuously Adaptive Dynamic Voltage/Frequency scaling in Linux systems running on Intel i7 and AMD Phenom II processors. By exploiting slack, inherent in memory-bound programs, our approach aims to improve power efficiency even when the processor does not sit idle. Our underlying methodology is based on a simple first-order processor performance model in which frequency scaling is expressed as a change (in cycles) of the main memory latency. Utilizing available monitoring hardware we show that our model is powerful enough to i) predict with reasonable accuracy the effect of frequency scaling (in terms of performance loss) and ii) predict the core energy under different V/f combinations. To validate our approach we perform highly accurate, fine-grained power measurements directly on the off-chip voltage regulators. We use our model to implement various DVFS policies as Linux “green” governors to continuously optimize for various power-efficiency metrics such as EDP or ED2P, or achieve energy savings with a user-specified limit on performance loss. Our evaluation shows that, for SPEC2006 workloads, our governors achieve dynamically the same optimal EDP or ED2P (within 2{\%} on avg.) as an exhaustive search of all possible frequencies. Energy savings can reach up to 56{\%} in memory-bound workloads with corresponding improvements of about 55{\%} for EDP or ED2P.},
